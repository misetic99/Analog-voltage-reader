# Analog-voltage-reader

An analog voltage reader is a project that uses the MATLAB platform and an Arduino UNO microcontroller.
This project is used to read the voltage from the analog input of the Arduino through programming in MATLAB and drawing a voltage graph.
I used MATLAB R2021a, many don't have such new versions of matlab so you have MATLAB code in txt format.
